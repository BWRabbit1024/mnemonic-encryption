- 🔐 Cross-platform encryption compatibility
- 📊 QR code generation for encrypted text sharing
- 📷 QR code scanner for importing encrypted text
- 💪 Password strength checker with detailed analysis
- 🛡️ Security information screen with technical specs
- 📱 Mobile-optimized UI with haptic feedback
- 🎨 Professional loading states and animations
- 📋 Clipboard integration with one-tap copy
- 🏗️ Improved project structure (mobile/, desktop/, docs/)
- 📄 LICENSE file (MIT License)
- 🔒 SECURITY.md with vulnerability reporting guidelines
- 📚 Comprehensive .gitignore files

### Changed
- 🔄 Restructured project into mobile/ and desktop/ directories
- 🔐 Optimized PBKDF2 iterations to 10,000 (mobile-friendly)
- 📝 Improved documentation and usage guides
- 🎯 Enhanced cross-platform compatibility

### Security
- ✅ Implemented AES-256-CBC encryption (NIST FIPS 197)
- ✅ Added PBKDF2 key derivation (RFC 2898)
- ✅ Cryptographically secure random salt generation
- ✅ Proper PKCS#7 padding (RFC 3852)
- ✅ Base64 encoding (RFC 4648)
- ✅ No data storage - all operations local

### Removed
- ❌ Deprecated AES_V1.2.py (security vulnerabilities)
- ❌ Old backup files and archives
- ❌ Build artifacts and cache files
- ❌ Unnecessary debug files

## [1.2.0] - 2021-10-03

### Added
- Initial Python implementation (AES_V1.2.py)
- Basic encryption/decryption functionality

### Security Issues (Fixed in 2.0.0)
- ⚠️ Used same key for encryption and IV (critical vulnerability)
- ⚠️ No proper key derivation function
- ⚠️ No salt generation
- ⚠️ Insecure padding with null bytes
- ⚠️ Custom non-standard cryptographic implementation

---

## Migration Guide

### From v1.2.0 to v2.0.0

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Data encrypted with AES_V1.2.py **CANNOT** be decrypted with v2.0.0 due to fundamental security improvements.

**Before upgrading:**
1. Decrypt all data encrypted with v1.2.0
2. Re-encrypt using v2.0.0 with a strong password
3. Test decryption on both mobile and desktop
4. Securely delete old encrypted files

**What's Changed:**
- New encryption format (incompatible with v1.2.0)
- Stronger security standards
- Cross-platform support
- Mobile application available

---

## Upcoming Features

### Planned for v2.1.0
- [ ] iOS App Store release
- [ ] Biometric authentication for mobile
- [ ] Multiple encryption profiles
- [ ] Batch encryption/decryption
- [ ] Export/import settings

### Under Consideration
- [ ] Hardware security key support
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Offline documentation
- [ ] Desktop GUI application
- [ ] Browser extension
